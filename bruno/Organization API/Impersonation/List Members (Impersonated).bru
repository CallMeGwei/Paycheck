  List org members using operator impersonation.

  This demonstrates how Console can call org API endpoints on behalf of a user
  without storing per-user API keys.

  Requirements:
  - Operator must have admin or owner role
  - X-On-Behalf-Of header must contain a valid member_id
  - The member must belong to the org in the URL path

  The request executes with the impersonated member's permissions.
