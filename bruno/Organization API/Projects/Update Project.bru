  Update a project (requires write access).
  All fields are optional - only include fields you want to update.

  Fields:
  - name: Project display name
  - domain: Project domain
  - license_key_prefix: Prefix for activation codes (e.g., "MYAPP" -> "MYAPP-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX")
  - email_from: "From" address for activation emails (set to null to use system default)
  - email_enabled: Enable/disable email delivery for this project
  - email_webhook_url: Webhook URL for DIY email delivery (set to null to disable)

  Email configuration:
  - To use Resend email with custom from address, org must have resend_api_key configured
  - To switch to webhook mode: set email_webhook_url to your endpoint URL
  - To disable email entirely: set email_enabled to false
  - To clear a setting, set it to null

  Note: Payment configuration (Stripe, LemonSqueezy) and Resend API key are managed
  at the organization level. Use PUT /operators/organizations/{org_id}.
